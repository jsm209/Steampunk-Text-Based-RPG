#CONCEPT#
#########
You have 20 days to spend before amassing a large enough crew before fighting The Maw.
The player must sucessfully manage the amount of crew, food, credits, fuel, hull, stress, and wisdom to sucessfully
defeat The Maw.
Food, credits, fuel, hull, and stress are all resources to manage,
While crew and wisdom need to be amassed to win the game.
The game is lost if the player doesn't gain enough crew and/or wisdom, or if they make the wrong choices.
A choice is "wrong" when the player doesn't read and pick up on context clues.

Resources: Credits, Food, Fuel, Hull, Stress, Crew, Wisdom

#GAMEPLAY#
##########
Each action, you and your crew can:
Explore - get a random traveling encounter and an exploration encounter
Dock - Take shelter and spend the night at a nearby isle. Must dock for 2 days.
Work - Take a random job to earn a random amount of credits.
Research - Attempt to find an important piece of information regarding Flux or The Maw.
Mine - Mine unrefined Flux to be used for fuel.
type examine explore for more information about explore, etc.

Exploration may cause crew to die, but some portion of the crew will always flee from fear.
Raises stress, depletes food, may deplete hull, costs fuel, but has high risk high reward outcomes.

Docking may or may not cause crew to come or leave, although it is the most likely choice to reliably gain crew.
It reduces stress, gives food and fuel, repairs hull, costs credits, and must dock for 2 days given flight regulations and docking time.

Work is a no risk way to earn credits, and has no effect on stress, but will deplete food. More work can be done
with a larger crew, resulting in jobs with larger paychecks.

Research may cause crew to die, but some portion of the crew will always flee from fear.
Greatly increases stress, depletes food, costs credits, but has high risk high reward outcomes.

Mine reliably gives fuel, depletes food, and gains crew because miners hate their jobs.

You can't explore or do research without at least a crew of 1, and 1 fuel.

General Scaling
Credits is base 100
Food is base 1
Fuel is base 1
Hull is base 1, max of 10
Stress is base 10, max of 100
Crew is base 1
Wisdom is base 1

The reward must be in a list in the standard resource order:
[Credits, Food, Fuel, Hull, Stress, Crew, Wisdom]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

##########################
#MECHANICS/IMPLEMENTATION#
##########################
Docking, mining, and working will always give and take a random amount of low sided dice, like d3, d4, and d6, and always have the same dialogue.
They are meant to be mechanical actions that aid the research and exploration choices.

Have an encounter class that has a description field, question field, result 1 field, and result 2 field.
Each of the result fields will be an array/list of integers of size 7 where each index represents a resource.
The encounter class should have methods to
print the description
ask the question, and call the right reward
a reward method that takes the current array of resources and adds the reward's array to it, returning the new array

Every encounter will be created using this class, and sorted into different arrays, one for traveling, one for exploring and one for researching. That way, I can randomly pick
an encounter from each list of encounters.

For the player class, I want to keep track of the resources, and have a method that given a list of resources, will add them to the current player's resources. Additionally, the player will be able to dock, mine, and work.

I also want a dice class, which can roll itself and be a d2, d3, d4, etc, depending on the
amount of sides I give it.

#INTRODUCTION#
##############
You're high above the clouds with your arms out wide, gliding over the floating kingdom of Zernear.
You fly over and under floating isles, weaving inbetween the roots that once held these islands to the ground 1000 years ago.
You realize that you've never felt so free, so light, exploring the expanse of the sky kingdom to your heart's content.
Almost immedietly, as if waiting for a cue, you feel a slight tugging. It begins to pull harder, until you realize
that you're no longer in control. Below, the once pristine clouds slowly turn to dark tufts, reminicient of exhaust from
many of the surrounding airships. The clouds begin to swirl into a vortex, with a dark void lying at its center.
As you look to your left, you can see the expressions of despair and nervousness on the faces of the crew members
aboard an airship, who are frantically flustering about, trying to drive away from the eye of the storm, but it is too late.
Their massive size only amplified the power of the winds, and they're quickly sucked into the vortex, ripped apart into
silence. Several surrounding isles are now meteors hurling towards the center, almost disintegrating completely by the
time they reach the center of the void. You thrust your arms out to your sides harder, thinking that with enough willpower,
you can fly away, but the pull of the hurricane proves too strong. As you creep closer to death, you look down at the
center and can smell the putrid scent of blood and rotten flesh. You spot teeth, with some crew members desperately clinging
trying not to fall to their doom. You slip into the darkness, only to have your ears pierced by a roar that would
cause even your village elders to hide in fear.

Do you:
Dive headfirst, shooting faster into the void.
  Fearless, start with a stress of 0.
Reach your arms out the furthest you've ever reached, in an attempt to glide away from your impending doom.
  Optimistic, start with a stress of 5.
Pray to your God and accept your fate.
  Pragmatic, start with a stress of 10.
Kick and punch into the darkness in an attempt to hurt the beast.
  Determined, start with a stress of 25.
Scream out and make known to the world who you love and what you're sorry for.
  Regretful, start with a stress of 15


Just then, you awake in a pool of sweat, to the sound of your alarm clock ringing. You're quick to remember your dream
and instinctually cut another notch into the side of your bedpost. One.. two.. four.. ten.... This marks the thirteenth
day in a row you've had this nightmare, and you sink into a depression with a sullen look on your face. You gaze outside
and see children playing, windmills churning, massive buildings and airships swirling, all around the floating isle you call home.
All this will be gone. The prophesy from your village elders proved true. Thirteen consecutive days of a dream almost
always accurately predicted the future, supported only by a handful of visions, of which The Great Vision is the most well known.

209 years ago, a great heroine had a reoccuring dream for thirteen days in a row. She described it as a calamity, and in an effort to
avoid the terrible fate, the kingdom of Zernear was torn from the Earth by ancient heroes, and levitated with Flux, an unwieldly
ancient power source. It was in an effort to flee from The Maw, a god-like beast of unknown origins, sealed away with a
collosal mechanical clamp constructed from Flux by the Zernear's best engineers and mechanics. Many docurments about
the event were lost, because only thirty percent of the kingdom was able to be made airborne. The remaining population
was left for dead as there was a lack of flight technology and Flux capacity. In order to avoid such a devestating blow
in the future, the king of Zernear devoted almost all resources towards improving flight technology and Flux research.

Exactly thirteen days ago, all of Zernear heard an unusual creaking
and snapping, conjuring memories of the tale, but ultimately assumed to simply be a Flux mining rig malfunction.
Your visions and memories of the history of Zernear only point to one logical explanation.
You quickly make the Kingdom know your visions, and the current King, makes the pragmatic decision to actually check
The Maw's prison...

... The King's technicians reported that the beast is roaring and struggling, slowly weakening the grip of the
floating prison. They estimate that even with continuous reinforcement and additional Flux that they can hold out for
another twenty days before The Maw escapes Zernear's hold. A call has been made to all citizens of Zernear to either
help find a solution, or band together to take down the beast.

Determined to be like the heroine of old, you set out in your airship and begin your journey.


# Details necessary to include in introduction:
    The Mawful Cult, and their insignia, which is a headless body.
    The undercity, where the Mawful Cult resides.
    Lugmere's government and the dilemma faced by the district if The Maw died or escaped. (Energy problems, Flux is
    limited)
    The value of Flux, how it's a non renewable resource, and how powerfully destructive it is.
    The Outerworld and R'yleh.
    The mistreatement of Lugmere against The Maw
    The floating prison
    The sheer size of The Maw
    The position of Lugmere, and relative size to The Maw



############################
# FINAL ENCOUNTER PLANNING #
############################
You can engage The Maw threat in two paths:
    With crew
    With wisdom

Both paths will ask a series of three encounters, with varying choices subtracting some amount of crew/wisdom depending
on if the player made a logical and lore friendly move. More lore friendly, less loss.

Sanity will deplete with resource loss, however if sanity is completely loss, the game is lost. If the player can't
sacrifice any more of a given resource, they go to a "losing scenario"

A losing scenario is basically a last ditch effort that the player has to roll successfully three times. If they do
they win the game. If not they lose.

Lore Friendly:
    The Maw is immune to Flux, and will actually become empowered by it if not a strong amount is used.
    The Maw is immune to poison.
    The Maw will only eat men.
    The Maw requires a sacrifice of 30.
    The claw prison requires 30 flux to reinforce itself.
    The Mawful cult is attempting to free The Maw, and will lie to do so.
    The Maw holds a portal in its mouth to the otherworld.
    The Maw actually means no harm if released, and will slither back through a rift down below.
    Lugmere's government strongly opposes releasing or killing The Maw, and wish to keep it captive.
    The Maw's main weakness is lava, as it is hot enough to ignite the oil on its skin.
    Flux and The Maw's energy are the same. Feeding The Maw Flux gives Lugmere a power surge.
    The Maw powers Lugmere with Flux.

Hmm. Rethinking this:
There is a starting scenario, that branches into two, and each of those branch into two. This results in 4 outcomes.
    (Crew encounter)
        The Maw is killed
            30 or more flux OR 30 or more crew members.
        The Claw is repaired
            30 or more flux OR 10 hull and 10 flux.
    (Wisdom encounter)
        The Maw is subdued
            crew * wisdom > the maw OR 30 crew sacrificed.
        The player succumbs to the Maw, eternally fighting it internally.
            wisdom < the maw OR player fails at any point in wisdom encounter.

I want the player to make three choices, so one choice will be how to deal with The Mawful Cult, another will be to
choose between a crew or wisdom encounter, and the last is to choose the course of action.

At any point, the player will lose and can only lose due to a lack of sanity. The player will make choices to travel
the branches, losing varying amounts of sanity based on their current resources.
At the end, in the final enounter with The Maw, her power is at a set amount * the flux it will steal from the player.
If the player has 30 or more, the maw is killed. Otherwise, the maw gets a score, and the player's score is
wisdom * crew.

If any of the options fail, the player's sanity drops to zero from shock, and they go to last hope encounter.

Use a bomb - Succeeds with 30 Flux or more.
Overload the clamp - Succeeds with 30 Flux or more, OR 20 crew and 20 Flux.
Organize an assault - Automatic failure
X Mind meld and overtake her - Succeeds with 20 wisdom.

X Fortify the clamp - Succeeds with 30 Flux or more, OR 20 crew and 20 Flux.
Make a worthy sacrifice - Succeeds with 30 crew.
Group mind meld - Succeeds with 20 crew AND 10 wisdom.
Release The Maw - Automatic failure.
