<span class="s0">description: 
Your uncle, a prosperous Flux mining rig foreman used to help fund the research of  
Dr. Stynbeck, an alienist by trade and a leading expert on research about The Maw.  
Both he and your uncle mysteriously disappeared 9 years ago, and are believed to be dead.  
However neither of their bodies were found and both of their homes fell victim to an  
unknown arsonist. One of the few heirlooms from your uncle that you inherited was a journal  
containing broken clues about their research. One of the entries contains the whereabouts  
of Dr. Stynbeck's hidden library, and your uncle's abandoned Flux mining rig. 
question: 
You can only spend the day investigating either location, but not both.  
Which do you choose? 
win: 
Your investigation proves fruitful, and you're enlightened with more knowledge about The Maw. 
You learn that The Maw has a cult following, and it is these individuals who destroyed much of  
the original research. Just as you realize this, you feel another presence nearby, and turn to look  
only to see a hooded figure quickly duck out of view... You fail to locate the mysterious figure.
