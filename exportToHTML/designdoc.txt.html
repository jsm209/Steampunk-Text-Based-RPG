#CONCEPT# 
######### 
You have 20 days to spend before amassing a large enough crew before fighting The Maw. 
The player must sucessfully manage the amount of crew, food, credits, fuel, hull, stress, and wisdom to sucessfully 
defeat The Maw. 
Food, credits, fuel, hull, and stress are all resources to manage, 
While crew and wisdom need to be amassed to win the game. 
The game is lost if the player doesn't gain enough crew and/or wisdom, or if they make the wrong choices. 
A choice is &quot;wrong&quot; when the player doesn't read and pick up on context clues. 
 
Resources: Credits, Food, Fuel, Hull, Stress, Crew, Wisdom 
 
########## 
#GAMEPLAY# 
########## 
Each action, you and your crew can: 
Explore - get a random traveling encounter and an exploration encounter 
Dock - Take shelter and spend the night at a nearby isle. Must dock for 2 days. 
Work - Take a random job to earn a random amount of credits. 
Research - Attempt to find an important piece of information regarding Flux or The Maw. 
Mine - Mine unrefined Flux to be used for fuel. 
type examine explore for more information about explore, etc. 
 
Exploration may cause crew to die, but some portion of the crew will always flee from fear. 
Raises stress, depletes food, may deplete hull, costs fuel, but has high risk high reward outcomes. 
 
Docking may or may not cause crew to come or leave, although it is the most likely choice to reliably gain crew. 
It reduces stress, gives food and fuel, repairs hull, costs credits, and must dock for 2 days given flight regulations and docking time. 
 
Work is a no risk way to earn credits, and has no effect on stress, but will deplete food. More work can be done 
with a larger crew, resulting in jobs with larger paychecks. 
 
Research may cause crew to die, but some portion of the crew will always flee from fear. 
Greatly increases stress, depletes food, costs credits, but has high risk high reward outcomes. 
 
Mine reliably gives fuel, depletes food, and gains crew because miners hate their jobs. 
 
########################## 
#MECHANICS/IMPLEMENTATION# 
########################## 
Docking, mining, and working will always give and take a random amount of low sided dice, like d3, d4, and d6, and always have the same dialogue. 
They are meant to be mechanical actions that aid the research and exploration choices. 
 
Have an encounter class that has a description field, question field, result 1 field, and result 2 field. 
Each of the result fields will be an array/list of integers of size 7 where each index represents a resource. 
The encounter class should have methods to 
print the description 
ask the question, and call the right reward 
a reward method that takes the current array of resources and adds the reward's array to it, returning the new array 
 
Every encounter will be created using this class, and sorted into different arrays, one for traveling, one for exploring and one for researching. That way, I can randomly pick 
an encounter from each list of encounters. 
 
For the player class, I want to keep track of the resources, and have a method that given a list of resources, will add them to the current player's resources. Additionally, the player will be able to dock, mine, and work. 
 
I also want a dice class, which can roll itself and be a d2, d3, d4, etc, depending on the 
amount of sides I give it.

#INTRODUCTION# 
############## 
You're high above the clouds with your arms out wide, gliding over the floating kingdom of Zernear. 
You fly over and under floating isles, weaving inbetween the roots that once held these islands to the ground 1000 years ago. 
You realize that you've never felt so free, so light, exploring the expanse of the sky kingdom to your heart's content. 
Almost immedietly, as if waiting for a cue, you feel a slight tugging. It begins to pull harder, until you realize 
that you're no longer in control. Below, the once pristine clouds slowly turn to dark tufts, reminicient of exhaust from 
many of the surrounding airships. The clouds begin to swirl into a vortex, with a dark void lying at its center. 
As you look to your left, you can see the expressions of despair and nervousness on the faces of the crew members 
aboard an airship, who are frantically flustering about, trying to drive away from the eye of the storm, but it is too late. 
Their massive size only amplified the power of the winds, and they're quickly sucked into the vortex, ripped apart into 
silence. Several surrounding isles are now meteors hurling towards the center, almost disintegrating completely by the 
time they reach the center of the void. You thrust your arms out to your sides harder, thinking that with enough willpower, 
you can fly away, but the pull of the hurricane proves too strong. As you creep closer to death, you look down at the 
center and can smell the putrid scent of blood and rotten flesh. You spot teeth, with some crew members desperately clinging 
trying not to fall to their doom. You slip into the darkness, only to have your ears pierced by a roar that would 
cause even your village elders to hide in fear. 
 
Do you: 
Dive headfirst, shooting faster into the void. 
  Fearless, start with a stress of 0. 
Reach your arms out the furthest you've ever reached, in an attempt to glide away from your impending doom. 
  Optimistic, start with a stress of 5. 
Pray to your God and accept your fate. 
  Pragmatic, start with a stress of 10. 
Kick and punch into the darkness in an attempt to hurt the beast. 
  Determined, start with a stress of 25. 
Scream out and make known to the world who you love and what you're sorry for. 
  Regretful, start with a stress of 15 
 
 
Just then, you awake in a pool of sweat, to the sound of your alarm clock ringing. You're quick to remember your dream 
and instinctually cut another notch into the side of your bedpost. One.. two.. four.. ten.... This marks the thirteenth 
day in a row you've had this nightmare, and you sink into a depression with a sullen look on your face. You gaze outside 
and see children playing, windmills churning, massive buildings and airships swirling, all around the floating isle you call home. 
All this will be gone. The prophesy from your village elders proved true. Thirteen consecutive days of a dream almost 
always accurately predicted the future, supported only by a handful of visions, of which The Great Vision is the most well known. 
 
209 years ago, a great heroine had a reoccuring dream for thirteen days in a row. She described it as a calamity, and in an effort to 
avoid the terrible fate, the kingdom of Zernear was torn from the Earth by ancient heroes, and levitated with Flux, an unwieldly 
ancient power source. It was in an effort to flee from The Maw, a god-like beast of unknown origins, sealed away with a 
collosal mechanical clamp constructed from Flux by the Zernear's best engineers and mechanics. Many docurments about 
the event were lost, because only thirty percent of the kingdom was able to be made airborne. The remaining population 
was left for dead as there was a lack of flight technology and Flux capacity. In order to avoid such a devestating blow 
in the future, the king of Zernear devoted almost all resources towards improving flight technology and Flux research. 
 
Exactly thirteen days ago, all of Zernear heard an unusual creaking 
and snapping, conjuring memories of the tale, but ultimately assumed to simply be a Flux mining rig malfunction. 
Your visions and memories of the history of Zernear only point to one logical explanation. 
You quickly make the Kingdom know your visions, and the current King, makes the pragmatic decision to actually check 
The Maw's prison... 
 
... The King's technicians reported that the beast is roaring and struggling, slowly weakening the grip of the 
floating prison. They estimate that even with continuous reinforcement and additional Flux that they can hold out for 
another twenty days before The Maw escapes Zernear's hold. A call has been made to all citizens of Zernear to either 
help find a solution, or band together to take down the beast. 
 
Determined to be like the heroine of old, you set out in your airship and begin your journey.
