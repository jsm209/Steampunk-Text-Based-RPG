as you fly past downtrodden islands

mention that the cavern can flood with lava unexpectedly

need a way to get food without also getting crew

--

steering airship contradicts that the storm can pull them in. Say steer slightly. also say you only have time to either deal with the riftlings, or steer away and deal with the riftlings later.

explicitly say that crew members starving reduces your sanity

If players are disabled, say explicitly that it skips their turn

make a roll to recollect your mind again.

make sure final scores displays everyone's scores even if they're disabled

recruiting possibly increases wisdom because someone can bring information with them

mention that research and exploration can also gain random resources, or lose random resources

explicitly say each turn is one day

give people a random title

fix lore about the maw being immune to flux

explicitly mention you will spend 13 days to muster the strength to find a solution. the end goal

instead of instantly dying from starvation, crew members have a 1/3 chance to stay vs. 2/3 deserting/dying. also say how many leave

make mind meld make sense

delete fourth option from maw encounters

reword release to loosen grip in maw encounter

score does not compute correctly
food is going missing
people are dying. help them.
hektor, kill yourself

New Idea: Combine research and exploration encounters, under one common label as "Encounter"
and instead replace research with a way to change the doom counter. "Tamper" will let you
either sacrifice 5 crew to push doom back 2 turns, or sacrifice 5 flux to push it forward two turns.
